    description: "A mid-size luxury crossover that combined minivan versatility with SUV styling and car-like handling. Built on a modified minivan platform (Chrysler CS platform), the Pacifica featured distinctive design elements including a sloping hood, prominent grille, and 5-door SUV body style. Production began in January 2003 with the final unit rolling off the assembly line on November 23, 2007. Available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configurations with seating for up to six passengers across three rows. Powered by gasoline engines including a 3.5L V6 (250 hp), 3.8L V6 (210-200 hp), and later 4.0L V6 (255 hp) with various automatic transmissions. The Pacifica featured premium materials, innovative storage solutions, and equipped with advanced technology for its time including optional navigation systems and DVD entertainment. Despite being touted as a pioneer in the crossover segment, sales underperformed expectations due to competition from established luxury crossovers, pricing perceived as high for the Chrysler marque, and comparison with the less expensive Town & Country minivan. The model was discontinued in 2007-2008 without a direct successor until the nameplate was revived for the minivan in 2017."

    description: "A minivan that replaced the Chrysler Town & Country, reviving the Pacifica nameplate for 2017 model year. Production began in 2016 at the Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada. Built on an all-new Compact Wide platform (different from the original crossover), the modern Pacifica features sleek, crossover-inspired styling to disassociate it from traditional boxy minivans. Powered by a 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine producing 287 hp, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission (948TE). The Pacifica marked the introduction of the first plug-in hybrid (PHEV) minivan in the United States market, available alongside conventional gasoline models, with the hybrid featuring 33 miles of electric-only range. Features include Stow 'n Go seating that folds flat into the floor, Uconnect infotainment systems, panoramic sunroof, hands-free sliding doors, and comprehensive driver assistance technology. An all-wheel drive option was introduced for 2020 model year. The entry-level Voyager nameplate was reintroduced in 2020 for lower-trim versions. The Pacifica earned numerous awards including IIHS Top Safety Pick+ and recognition as best family vehicle from multiple publications."
