    description: "The original Chrysler Pacifica pioneered the luxury crossover segment, combining minivan versatility with SUV styling and car-like handling. Built on a modified minivan platform, it featured a distinctive design with a sloping hood and prominent grille. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations with seating for six passengers across three rows, it offered a more upscale alternative to traditional minivans. Powered primarily by a 3.5L V6 (later 4.0L V6), it prioritized comfort over performance. The interior featured premium materials and innovative storage solutions, though the third row was somewhat cramped. Despite initial success, sales declined as the model aged and competition increased, leading to its discontinuation without a direct replacement. This version of the Pacifica represented Chrysler's early attempt to address shifting consumer preferences away from traditional minivans while maintaining family-friendly versatility."

    description: "The Pacifica name was revived for Chrysler's all-new minivan, replacing the Town & Country. Built on a purpose-designed platform, it features sleek, almost crossover-like styling that disguises its minivan functionality. Powered by a 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 287 HP paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission, it offers responsive performance with competitive fuel economy. The interior showcases premium materials and thoughtful design, with Chrysler's innovative Stow 'n Go seating that allows second and third-row seats to fold flat into the floor. Technology features include an available Uconnect Theater rear-seat entertainment system with dual 10-inch touchscreens, panoramic sunroof, and comprehensive driver assistance systems. A significant update in 2021 refreshed the exterior styling, added the new Uconnect 5 infotainment system with a 10.1-inch touchscreen, and introduced the Pinnacle ultra-luxury trim with quilted leather and unique appointments. The Pacifica continues as Chrysler's flagship vehicle, offering class-leading versatility and technology in the minivan segment. A hybrid variant (detailed separately) provides an electrified option, while the entry-level Voyager (essentially a de-contented Pacifica) serves budget-conscious buyers."
